# routingjoin
## Plot, calculate and join routes in python

#### This project has two main objectives. 

- 1 - Simple_route.ipynb
Calculate a simple route between two points in the world without any input different of theses two coordinates and show in a pretty plotly graphic.

- 2 - second_script.ipynb
Having a pool of routes, join the ones that cross each other with a closer destination recalculating is. This one is a bit more complicated.

I think it's well explained in code,feel free to use this code as your needs.
If you don't understand the code send me a message.
